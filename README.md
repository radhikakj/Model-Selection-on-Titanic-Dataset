# Model Selection on Titanic Dataset

This repository contains code for training and evaluating machine learning models on the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used for classification tasks, where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, ticket class, and others.

## Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. It consists of the following features:

- **Survived:** Binary variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- **Pclass:** Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- **Name:** Passenger's name.
- **Sex:** Passenger's gender.
- **Age:** Passenger's age.
- **SibSp:** Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch:** Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Ticket:** Ticket number.
- **Fare:** Passenger's fare.
- **Cabin:** Cabin number.
- **Embarked:** Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Setup

To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python 3.x along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Models Explored

In this repository, we explore the  machine learning models for predicting survival on the Titanic.

##  Results

After evaluating each model, we compare their performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing model for this dataset.
